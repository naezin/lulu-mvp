## 📱 Features

### Core Tracking

- 🍼 **Feeding** — Breast, bottle, formula, or solids
- 😴 **Sleep** — Start/end times with quality notes
- 🧷 **Diaper** — Wet, dirty, or both
- 🎮 **Play** — Activity types and duration
- 💊 **Health** — Temperature, symptoms, medications

### Smart Features

**Sweet Spot Sleep Prediction**  
Based on wake windows and your baby's age, LULU predicts the optimal time for sleep—before overtiredness kicks in.

**Individual Tracking for Multiples**  
No "both babies" shortcuts. Each baby gets their own timeline, because twins aren't the same baby twice.

**Corrected Age Support**  
For preemies, all developmental milestones and recommendations use corrected age automatically.
